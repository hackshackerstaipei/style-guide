# Using the logos

 These templates allow you to create a new combination mark (H/H mark + long or abbreviated city) for a local Hacks/Hackers group.

Illustrator - `ai/hackshackers_identity.ai` contains several artboards with the various vector formats of the identity

Photoshop - use psd/hackshackers_cm-group-long.psd or psd/hackshackers_cm-group-abbr.psd

Other - Using a tool like Preview in OS X, you can lay out the Hacks/Hackers logomark (jpg, png or pdf), followed by the group's name in Arial font, all capital letters.
